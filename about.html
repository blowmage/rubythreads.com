	<h1>About Ruby Threads</h1>
	<p>We sell shirts. You buy them. Its a match made in heaven.</p>
  <p>Ruby Threads is run by Mike Moore. Mike is the driving force behind <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/">MountainWest RubyConf</a> and has enjoyed creating t-shirts for it. So he thought he'd expand to make more than one shirt a year. We are excited to see where this goes.</p>
  <p>Questions? Comments? Contact Mike at <a href="mailto:mike@rubythreads.com">mike@rubythreads.com</a> and he'll get you taken care of.</p>
